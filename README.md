Chastity Device: Modification of jfedor's Flatbox R3

This is a modification of [jfedor's flatbox rev3](https://github.com/jfedor2/flatbox/tree/master/hardware-rev3).

I've made some minor rearrangements to the traces and button placement, as well as changing the tact switches to SMD parts. The board itself is a rounded rectangle as well, so as to use a stacked acrylic case.

To fully assemble you will need:

* [Brook PS3/PS4 fighting board PCB](https://www.brookaccessory.com/detail/58690501/)
* 12x Kailh low profile (choc v1) switches of your choice
* Compatible keycaps
* 6x Chicago Screws
* Acrylic panels for the case
* Soldering iron

You will need 1 each of acrylic panels 1-4. They must be the following thicknesses:

* 1 - Bottom Panel: Any
* 2 - Lower Mid Panel: Any
* 3 - Upper Mid Panel: 4.5mm. A thinner panel will not provide enough spacing for the top panel to sit flat above the tact switches.
* 4 - Top Panel: 3 mm. A thicker panel will render the tact switches unusable.
